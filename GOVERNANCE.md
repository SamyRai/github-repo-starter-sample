# Governance

## Overview

This repository uses a meritocratic governance model. Contributors who make
sustained, high-quality contributions may be invited to become maintainers.

## Roles

- **Maintainers** — Review and merge PRs, manage releases, and serve as
  project contacts.

- **Contributors** — Anyone who files issues or PRs; contributions are
  reviewed by maintainers.

## Decision-making & RFCs

- Small changes are decided by maintainers.

- Major changes should be proposed as an RFC: open an issue or discussion
  with a clear proposal, a rationale, and a 2-week review period. After
  discussion, maintainers will merge or close the RFC.

## Releases & Backports

- Release cadence: define a cadence (e.g., monthly or on-demand) and update
  `RELEASE.md` or project metadata when using the template.

- Backports: backport policy should be defined per-release; by default,
  security fixes may be backported to supported versions.

## Becoming a maintainer

- Demonstrate sustained contributions and collaboration; maintainers
  nominate and agree on responsibilities.

For process or private matters, contact the maintainers as listed in the
repository.
