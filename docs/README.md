# Docs

Use this folder for project documentation. Recommended structure:

- `docs/architecture.md` — design decisions and architecture overview

- `docs/getting-started.md` — extended setup and examples

- `docs/release-notes.md` — notable changes per release

Keep docs concise, link from `README.md`, and add a short frontmatter block
when publishing docs to a site.
